### Welcome to the Autumn 2016 offering of CS68SI!

Version control is one of the most important tools in a software engineerâ€™s toolbox: it aids collaboration, allows for streamlined prototyping of ideas, and eases code sharing and reuse. Git is the most popular version control software today; throughout this course you will explore this software and the ecosystem it creates. In the first half of this class, we will introduce basic git usage with the command line, Github, theoretical concepts of version control, and common pitfalls of version control such as merge conflicts and detached heads. In the second portion of the course, we will cover advanced git and Github techniques including post-commit hooks, the Github API, and Github website hosting.
