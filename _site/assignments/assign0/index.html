The standard CS 107 will also have a UNIX lab in week 1 which we’ll announce to the class, should you want to attend.<p>You should also read through the other <a href="/guides">course guides</a> for information about hardware and the Pi, which we’ll start working with in week 2.<h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><h4 id="step-1-set-up-git">Step 1: Set up Git</h4><p>First, <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">install Git on your Mac or Linux machine</a>.<p>Then open a Terminal window and type everything after <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ </code> on these lines so that Git marks your changes with who you are:<p>(Replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">My Name</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">myemail@stanford.edu</code> with your own.)<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git config --global user.name "My Name"
$ git config --global user.email myemail@stanford.edu

You’ll download assignments from there and later push your solutions back up.<p>If you don’t have an account already, <a href="https://github.com">sign up now</a>. Then fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p4D5ip4xt3qvTJIXA-LD_aOWfSInPGPm2WsxS6ZLyjM/viewform">our Google form</a> so we know what your GitHub username is. <strong>You should do this by class on Friday of week 1.</strong><p>We’ll set up a private repository just for your assignments, inside the <a href="https://github.com/cs107e">CS107e organization</a>, after we’ve got everyone’s accounts.<p>We’ll e-mail you then, once you’ve been set up and ready to move on to Part 2.

You’ll do your work inside that folder. (You might have to type in your GitHub username and password.)<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone -b assign0 https://github.com/cs107e/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]-assignments assign0

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Important</strong>: always make sure that you specify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-b assignX</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-b assign0</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-b assign1</code>, or whatever the assignment is) option when starting an assignment. Otherwise, you might get the wrong starter code and submit to the wrong place!<p>Now you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd assign0</code> to move into that folder and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to see the starter file there. There should be just one, lab.txt.<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls

Replace its contents with one of these four options. Make sure you use the exact same text (your submission will be automatically checked):<ul><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Tuesday</code><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Tuesday, can't make Wednesday</code><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Wednesday</code><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Wednesday, can't make Tuesday</code></ul><p>Save the file.<h4 id="step-5-commit-your-change">Step 5: Commit your change</h4><p>Now Git recognizes that you’ve changed the assignment from the original starter code. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> and you should see something like:<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git status
On branch assign0
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/assign0'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lab.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre></div><p>Next you’ll <em>commit</em> the change you just made and set a kind of ‘checkpoint’ with the folder how it is right now.<p>First, <em>stage</em> the lab.txt file so Git knows to record it as part of the commit.<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git add lab.txt

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	modified:   lab.txt

</code></pre></div><p>Finally, commit your change, along with a short description of what exactly you did to the original code. Your terminal output should resemble:<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git commit -m "Entered my lab preference."

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

But for future assignments, you might need to manually change to the branch for that assignment to see your code on GitHub:<p><img title="Changing to another branch." src="images/03-change-branch.png" width="400" /><p>(The <code class="highlighter-rouge">submit-assignX</code> branches are placeholders used for submission; you shouldn’t need to touch them other than using them as base branches for your submission pull request [see the next section].)<h5 id="step-62-create-a-pull-request">Step 6.2: Create a pull request</h5><p>It’s time to actually submit the assignment for grading. In this course, we’ll use GitHub’s <em>pull request</em> feature to handle assignment submission and to give you feedback on your code.<p>(In a work environment, you might want to write a new feature or make some other change without disrupting the master copy of the code. You’d go off on a separate <em>branch</em>, do your work, and then create a <em>pull request</em> when you were done. A pull request is you asking your coworkers to review your changes and, if they look good, merge them back into the main line of code. We’re using pull requests similarly, except a grader instead of a coworker is reviewing your code, and the master copy is just the starter code.)<p>Open the assignment repository page in your browser. Make sure it’s on branch <code class="highlighter-rouge">assign0</code>; you can also go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/cs107e/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]-assignments/tree/assign0</code> directly.<p>Click the ‘New pull request’ button on your assignment repository page.<p><img title="We're on the right branch, so let's make a new pull request." src="images/04-new-pull-request.png" width="300" /><p>It’ll say “There isn’t anything to compare” at first. You need to set the base branch to <code class="highlighter-rouge">submit-assign0</code>. Make sure the branch shown next to ‘compare’ is <code class="highlighter-rouge">assign0</code>, too.<p><img title="Get the base and head branches right." src="images/05-choose-base.png" width="500" /><p>Then you’ll get a comparison of your project to your starter code, plus some areas to describe the changes.<p>Set the Title to “Submit assign0” and leave the description blank. (You should write a separate README file in your repository if you want to make comments.)<p><img title="Ready to create the pull request." src="images/06-create-pull-request.png" width="500" /><p>Then click ‘Create pull request’. You’ll get this pull request page:<p><img title="Pull request page." src="images/07-pull-request.png" width="500" /><p>You should see a green checkmark and a message that “All checks have passed”. You might need to wait a minute or two and refresh if they’re still running. (If the checks don’t pass, then make sure you replaced lab.txt with one of the four choices we gave!)<p>We have some basic automatic checks that will run on each assignment; you can see more about the results by clicking Details. In assignment 0, the check is just that you wrote down one of the four choices in lab.txt.<p>If you push changes to your assignment after creating the pull request (to fix any errors the checker detected, for example), they’ll automatically get added to this page. You might want to bookmark it, because the grader will give you feedback on your code here later.<p>But <strong>do not</strong> click ‘Merge pull request’! Your grader will click that button to let you know that they’re done grading your assignment.<p>(Note: the <strong>time of the last commit you push onto the pull request</strong>, not the time you clicked ‘Create pull request’, will be considered your time of submission for deadlines and late days. If you create the pull request at 11:59 but then push an extra commit on at 12:01 to fix an error from the autochecker, you’re past the deadline.)<h3 id="afterward-graders-code-review">Afterward: Grader’s code review</h3><p>As we review your code, we’ll put both line-specific and general comments on the pull request page:<p><img title="Comments." src="images/08-comments.png" width="500" /><p>Click the ‘Files changed’ tab to see your whole solution from top to bottom, along with the comments your grader made.<p><img title="Files changed." src="images/09-files-changed.png" width="500" /><p>When your grader’s done with their review, they’ll click the Merge button themselves, just like a coworker might Merge a pull request when they’re satisfied that it doesn’t break anything.</div></div></div><script src="/noita/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script> <script src="/noita/js/vendor/fastclick.js"></script> <script src="/noita/js/foundation.min.js"></script> <script>$(document).foundation();</script>
