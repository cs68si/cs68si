You may make subdirectories if you feel it is necessary to organize your code, but there are some files we require to be in the top-level assignment directory, as outlined below. Following these practices will ensure you pass the sanity check.<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3><p>In early assignments, the assignment directory will contain a Makefile, which runs the commands necessary to build the binary file that may then be loaded on your Pi. Once you learn about Makefiles and the build process, we will stop providing these for you. At that point, we will expect you to create your own Makefile in the top-level assignment directory. This Makefile should compile your code into a binary file using the single command ‘make’, and the binary output should also end up in the top-level directory. An example Makefile with explanations can be found in the <a href="/guides/make">make guide</a>.<h3 id="gitignore">.gitignore</h3><p>A .gitignore file is a hidden file that Git uses to determine what files or types of files should not be saved and tracked. Generally, developers only wish to track changes to source files, so they include any automatically-generated files in .gitignore.<p>In our case, you should not add any binary files (such as the output generated by ‘make’) to your Github repository. We will regenerate these binary files from your source code (using your Makefile) when we grade your assignment. So that you do not need to manually avoid including these binary files, your assignment repository includes a .gitignore that will skip over binary file types. Do not delete this .gitignore file or remove the lines in it. You may add to it if there are other files you would not like Git to track.</div></div></div><script src="/noita/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script> <script src="/noita/js/vendor/fastclick.js"></script> <script src="/noita/js/foundation.min.js"></script> <script>$(document).foundation();</script>
